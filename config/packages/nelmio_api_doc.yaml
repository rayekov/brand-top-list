            title: Brand Top List API
            description: |
                A RESTful API for managing brand toplists with geolocation-based configuration.

                ## Main Features
                - Geolocation-based toplist retrieval using CF-IPCountry header
                - CRUD operations for brands, countries, and toplist entries
                - Automatic fallback to default toplist

                ## Authentication
                Admin endpoints require authentication.

                ## Geolocation
                The API uses Cloudflare's CF-IPCountry header to determine user location.
                If no header is present, it falls back to the default country.
